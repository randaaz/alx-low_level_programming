# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Overview
This project involves the implementation and understanding of search algorithms in C. The main goal is to develop solutions for linear search and binary search while adhering to coding and documentation standards. The project must be completed by March 14, 2024, and will be checked through an auto review process. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a search algorithm is.
- Understand the concepts of linear search and binary search.
- Determine the best search algorithm based on specific needs.

## Resources
Before starting the project, it's recommended to read or watch content on the following topics:

- Search algorithm
- Space complexity (O(1))
- Search Algorithms video playlist

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options
- Code follows the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only allowed to use the `printf` function from the standard library
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `search_algos.h`
- Header files should be include guarded

### Tasks
- 6 mendotory tasks.
- 9 advanced tasks.
