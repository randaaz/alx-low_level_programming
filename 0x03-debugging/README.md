In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive
_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about
Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive or negative() 
gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01.
 C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.
You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive or negative() function.
You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an
infinite loop.
Fix the code in 2-largest number.c
